raw network data is too large for github. There is a .gitignore that will ignore the directories YEAST and FRUIT_FLY (with the three subdirectories in each)
that are in the network directories available on the brentlab website.

click on RELEASES under Netprophet2.0. NOTE: .gitignore will ignore the following paths ./data/FRUIT_FLY and ./data/YEAST

NOTE: data/fruitfly and data/yeast are not in .gitignore and do contain use-able data
